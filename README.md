# Hammock-Meditation-App
### CTP Hackathon Summer 2022 - Team Rocket: Ahmed Iftiak, Burnsley Lafleur, Jared Hwee, and Philip Park

## Inspiration
  * Mental health issues plague many students and adults because of the pressures of modern society.

## What it does
  * It allows users to press icons and have a corresponding video play, as well as, an accompanying audio playlist that matches a specific theme of relaxation.

## How we built it
  * We came together and decided to create a single-page website because this is the first iteration. We used HTML, CSS, and JS. We hope to incorporate Python, Django, and AWS in the future. Miro was used for our mock-up.

## Challenges we ran into
  * Communication, especially in a virtual setting is always an issue, but we worked through it.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
  * It took awhile to come to a conclusion about what app to build out. We decided to take a vote and the democratic approach allowed us to proceed with the app. We are proud because we were able to push through and submit a first iteration. A first iteration is not meant to be perfect and so we will continue to work as a team to make sure that the app we envision comes to fruition.

## What we learned
  * We learned that organization and planning is paramount. We also learned to challenge ourselves and perseverance is a key attribute for any developer.

## What's next for Hammock
  * We will work as a team and build out all the necessary features to make Hammock the go-to app for those who seek serenity through a digital device. :)

## Built With
  * css * html * javascript * miro
